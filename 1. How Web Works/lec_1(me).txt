How The Web Works ?

HTTP
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

Hypertext - Text Document which contains link which points to any other document
            Hyper link Text (Web Docs)
            documents which are pointing to any other document

Transfer - Sharing of these web docs
Protocol - Set of Rules to share this web docs

HTTP is Human Readable Protocol

Stateless Protocol - 

state means we maintain the state every time we visit the page.
Stateless means everytime you visit a page, you are a new user
(no memory of prev. req.)
you do not require to store the cuurent state

ex: incognito mode

in HTTP, there is no rule so it can maintain the states
we still keep it Stateless


                request
|----------| --------------------> |------|
| Computer |                       |Server|
|__________| <-------------------- |______|
                response

Session:
Sores state between frontend and backend

we store the interaction between browser and server in the form of cookies


|----------|                       |------|
| Browser  | <-------------------> |Server|
|__________|        cookie         |______|

cookies are key value pair information
ex: name = "John"

browser needs to send the information to server
and server also needs to send the information to browser

so cookie comes from both side
(cookie = information)

HTTP Headers (information)
but what information?
- client
- browser info
- date time
- cookie to store

Request - Response Model

                get
|----------| --------------------> |------|
| Browser  |                       |Server|
|__________| <-------------------- |______|
                200

type of request = [get,post,delete,..]
response code = [200,404,500,..]

we send http Headers with request
a response can be or cannot be a cookie

- what action to perform
- wher to perform.   http://api.hitesh.ai/auth
- was it done  200,404

HTTP/2

- 75% to 80% of web traffic is being handled by HTTP/2
(one of most powerful version)
- (not related to web3)

- http means http2
    |
    --> hhtp/1.1 is a fallback & is still used

http/1.1 can handle only one request at a time
while http/2 can handle multiple request at a time
when we request for some important info. , http/2 also send other important info. with requested info.

this is called multiplexing (many files at same time)
http2 uses compression.
http2 also uses encryption. (https)

(in aws, we don't use https for internal communication)

- TCP (Transmission control Protocol)
- FTP (file Transfer Protocol)
- IP (Internet Protocol)
- URL (Uniform resource locator)
- DNS (Domain name system)

- Header (Pass Addtional information)
- Payload (Actual data - email, Pass)
- Cache (store the data)


|----------|                       |--------|
|          |-----------------------|        |
| Browser  |-----------------------| Server |
|__________|                       |________|

- setup tcp connection
- exchange tls certificate
- send verb + url + data + more
- gets the response back with code & data (img, csv, text)
- tcp connection is closed (Stateless)
- this is how web works

we use wireshark, ns3 to visualize this process

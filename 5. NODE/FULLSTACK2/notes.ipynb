    "# FullStack Backend Project - Node.js & Express\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 Description\n",
    "This is a backend project for practicing full-stack development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The project focuses on building an authentication system with user verification and password reset functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Technologies Used\n",
    "- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime\n",
    "- **Express.js** - Web framework\n",
    "- **MongoDB** - Database\n",
    "- **Mongoose** - MongoDB object modeling\n",
    "- **dotenv** - Environment variable management\n",
    "- **nodemon** - Development tool for auto-reloading\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📁 Project Structure\n",
    "```\n",
    "FULLSTACK2/\n",
    "├── index.js          # Main server file\n",
    "├── package.json       # Dependencies and scripts\n",
    "├── utils/\n",
    "│   └── db.js         # Database connection\n",
    "└── .env              # Environment variables\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install dependencies\n",
    "npm install\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start development server\n",
    "npm run dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment Variables\n",
    "Create a `.env` file in the root directory:\n",
    "```env\n",
    "PORT=3000\n",
    "MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://admin:<db_password>@cluster0.f7wudhx.mongodb.net/\n",
    "BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌐 Available Ports\n",
    "The following ports are commonly used and available:\n",
    "- 3002\n",
    "- 4000\n",
    "- 5000\n",
    "- 5173\n",
    "- 8080\n",
    "- 8000\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📡 HTTP Request Types\n",
    "The server handles four main types of HTTP requests:\n",
    "- **GET** - Retrieve data\n",
    "- **POST** - Create new data\n",
    "- **PUT** - Update existing data\n",
    "- **DELETE** - Remove data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Server Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Express Middleware\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Parse JSON data\n",
    "app.use(express.json())\n",
    "\n",
    "// Parse URL-encoded data\n",
    "app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}))\n",
    "\n",
    "// CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication\n",
    "// Restricts direct client access to backend\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Port Configuration\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const port = process.env.PORT || 4000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note**: In production, the server allocates the port automatically. Using `process.env.PORT` is a best practice for deployment on platforms like Render, Digital Ocean, or AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗄️ Database Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "### MongoDB with Mongoose\n",
    "- **Direct MongoDB connection**: Possible but not recommended\n",
    "- **Mongoose**: Acts as a middleman between backend and MongoDB\n",
    "- **Benefits**: Easier to use than direct MongoDB queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection Requirements\n",
    "1. Database setup\n",
    "2. IP whitelisting\n",
    "3. Username and password\n",
    "4. **Important**: Avoid special characters in MongoDB user passwords to prevent connection errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mongoose Features\n",
    "- Automatic timestamp fields when `timestamp: true` is set:\n",
    "  - `createdAt`\n",
    "  - `updatedAt`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 Authentication System\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Schema Fields\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "{\n",
    "  name: String,\n",
    "  email: String,\n",
    "  password: String,\n",
    "  role: String, // e.g., \"teacher\", \"student\" for LMS\n",
    "  isVerified: Boolean,\n",
    "  verificationToken: String,\n",
    "  passwordResetToken: String,\n",
    "  passwordResetExpires: Date,\n",
    "  createdAt: Date,\n",
    "  updatedAt: Date\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Password Reset Flow\n",
    "1. **Step 1**: User sends password reset request to `/reset` route with email\n",
    "2. **Step 2**: Server checks if email exists in database\n",
    "   - If not found: Send \"account doesn't exist\" message\n",
    "   - If found: Proceed to step 3\n",
    "3. **Step 3**: Generate random token (e.g., \"jnegyqhudseq\")\n",
    "4. **Step 4**: Send token copy to user and store copy in database\n",
    "5. **Step 5**: User visits `/reset-password` route with token\n",
    "6. **Step 6**: Server validates token against database\n",
    "7. **Step 7**: If valid, allow password reset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Token Security**: Tokens expire after 5-10 minutes using `passwordResetExpires` field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Verification Flow\n",
    "1. **Step 1**: User signs up and receives verification email/OTP\n",
    "2. **Step 2**: User visits `/verify` page and enters OTP\n",
    "3. **Step 3**: Server compares OTP with stored `verificationToken`\n",
    "4. **Step 4**: If valid, mark user as verified\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛡️ Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment Variables\n",
    "- Store sensitive data in `.env` file\n",
    "- Never commit `.env` to version control\n",
    "- Use `.env.sample` for sharing environment structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)\n",
    "- **Problem**: Separation of frontend and backend (unlike traditional PHP/Laravel monoliths)\n",
    "- **Solution**: Implement CORS to restrict direct client access\n",
    "- **Goal**: Only allow frontend to communicate with backend\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Development Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies Types\n",
    "1. **Crucial Dependencies**: Required for production (express, mongoose, dotenv)\n",
    "2. **Development Dependencies**: Only needed during development (nodemon)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nodemon\n",
    "- Monitors Node.js applications\n",
    "- Automatically reloads server on file changes\n",
    "- Essential for development workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Routes and Controllers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Route Structure\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// ❌ Incorrect - missing leading slash\n",
    "app.get(\"kusum\", (req, res) => {\n",
    "    res.send(\"kusum!\")\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "// ✅ Correct - with leading slash\n",
    "app.get(\"/kusum\", (req, res) => {\n",
    "    res.send(\"kusum maa!\")\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Controllers\n",
    "Controllers handle the response logic:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// This function is the controller\n",
    "(req, res) => {\n",
    "    res.send(\"kusum maa!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice**: Separate routes and controllers for better code organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Deployment Notes\n",
    "- Use environment variables for configuration\n",
    "- Server automatically allocates ports in production\n",
    "- Ensure all sensitive data is in environment variables\n",
    "- Test CORS configuration with frontend\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Understand backend-frontend separation\n",
    "- Implement secure authentication flows\n",
    "- Work with MongoDB and Mongoose\n",
    "- Handle environment variables securely\n",
    "- Implement token-based verification systems\n"
